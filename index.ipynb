This takes live raw data from NASA's systems and turn them into APIs related to space and spacecraft.

To access them, you would add the endpoint to the base url of the API.\n","\n","For the OpenNotify API, we have following end points \n","\n","1. Current Location of the International Space Station `/iss-now.json`\n","2. Overhead Pass Predictions for the International Space Station `/iss-pass.json`    \n","3. Number of People in Space `/astros.json`\n","\n","The `.json` extension simply tells us that the data is being returned in a JSON format.\n","\n","In this lab, we'll be querying this API to retrieve live data about the International Space Station (ISS). Details on OpenNofity, endpoints, syntax, and the services it offers can be viewed [Here](http://open-notify.org/Open-Notify-API/)\n","\n","![](images/iss.jpg)\n","\n","### Current location of International Space Station\n","\n","The first endpoint we'll look at on Open Notify is the ` iss-now.json` endpoint (current location of international space station). This endpoint gets the current latitude and longitude of the International Space Station.  Perform the following tasks \n","* Make a get request to get the latest position of the international space station from the opennotify api's `iss-now` endpoint at
